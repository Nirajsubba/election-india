Project: Indian Election Data Analysis (Power BI)
Objective
The purpose of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of Indian general election results using Power BI. The goal was to identify voting trends, party performance, candidate margins, and state-level participation, while presenting the findings in an interactive and visually compelling dashboard.
Data Preparation
Imported raw election dataset containing party-wise votes, candidate names, states, constituencies, margins, and seat counts.
Performed data cleaning in Power Query: handled missing values, standardized party/candidate names, and converted numerical fields (votes, margins) into the correct format.
Created calculated columns and measures (DAX) for metrics such as:
   • Total votes by party
   • Margin of victory (highest, lowest, and average)
   • Seat count per party
   • Winning percentage per constituency
   • Runner-up party performance
Dashboard & Visuals
Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights:
1. Party Performance
•	BJP secured the highest seats (240) and largest share of votes.
•	Top 5 parties by total votes received visualized using bar chart.

2. Candidate Margins
•	Shankar Lalwani won by the highest margin (1,175,092 votes).
•	Ravindra Dattaram Waikar had the narrowest victory (48 votes).

3. State-Level Insights
•	Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest voter turnout (42M+ votes).
•	Lakshadweep had the lowest (25K votes).




4. Competitiveness
•	Only 14 constituencies had winners with margins above 50%.
•	YSR Congress had the most runner-up positions (26), showing competitive presence.

5. Independent Candidates
•	Only 1 independent candidate managed to win, reflecting the dominance of political parties.

6. Winning Percentages Table
•	Tabular report of each winning candidate’s vote share percentage for constituency-level detail.

Key Insights & Learnings
•	BJP dominance is clear, with massive lead in both seats and votes compared to other parties.
•	Election competitiveness varies significantly: from landslide wins (1M+ margin) to razor-thin victories (48 votes).
•	State size and demographics play a big role: Uttar Pradesh is a deciding factor with the highest votes, while smaller territories like Lakshadweep barely impact results.
•	Runner-up analysis shows where opposition parties have strongholds but couldn’t convert them into wins.
•	Independents rarely succeed in large-scale elections, highlighting reliance on major parties.
Tools & Techniques Used
•	Power BI Desktop for data modeling and visualization
•	Power Query for cleaning and transformation
•	DAX for calculated measures (vote percentages, margins, seat count)
•	Custom visuals (cards, bar charts, tables, KPIs) for storytelling
Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to transform raw election data into actionable insights through clear, interactive dashboards. It showcases proficiency in:
•	Data cleaning & modeling
•	DAX calculations
•	Dashboard design & storytelling
•	Deriving meaningful conclusions for political and social analysis
